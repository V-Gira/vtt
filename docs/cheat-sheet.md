## When to Roll

When should you roll those 4dF

- "Fiction first"
- Roll Fudge Dice and add Skill
- Add free invokes
- Invoke an Aspect (1 Fate) for +2 or reroll

## Stress

Think "plot armor" to avoid or absorb hits

- Two stress tracks - physical and mental, both reset at end of fight
- When hit, can cross off ONE stress box to absorb some or all of it
- Physique and Will grant additional 3-pt and 4-pt stress boxes

## Consequences

Lasting injuries or setbacks from conflict

- Fill out a new (negative) aspect to absorb blows
- 3 slots - Mild (worth 2), Moderate (worth 4), Severe (worth 6)

- Mild: Black Eye, Bruised, Winded, Flustered, Cranky
- Moderate: Deep Cut, First Degree Burn, Exhausted, Terrified
- Severe: Leg Fracture, Guts Hanging Out, Crippling Shame

- Can be invoked against you, with one free invoke for your foes
- Takes +2/+4/+6 Overcome to treat, then heal one level per session

## Conceding

Losing on your own terms

- Can't cover a hit with stress or consequences? You're Taken Out
- This is very bad - the GM decides what happens to you
- Conceding lets you have a say in what happens next
- Get 1 Fate for conceding, plus 1 for each consequence taken

## Stunts

Situational Bonus

- PCs get 3 free stunts (talent, gear, etc..)
- Additional stunts costs 1 Refresh. Cannot go below 1 Refresh.
- [More Stunts](/fate-stunts)
